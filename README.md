# Scotland_Geojson_Files
This repository contains the various versions of Scottish geojson files. I spent some time getting these in the right format to create a Python Plotly Choropleth and thought they may be useful to others.

The Scotland_Councils_With_Wards_Geojson folder contains the original geojson files for each council area of Scotland. Each of these Geojson files contains multiple 'features' which represent the constituent wards which make up the council. This would be suitable is you had data at a ward level for each council but for my purposes I wanted to create a choropleth chart with data representing each of Scotlands 32 council areas at a whole.

The Scotland_Councils_Without_Wards_Geojson folder contains the outpout geojson files which represent each of the 32 Scottish council areas as a single feature.
